To-Do / Incomplete / Warnings

High Priority (Do Not Ship):

*   `_sync()`: Needs to handle the case where we 'sync' but cannot acquire resources. Marked as `// **warning todo do-not-ship`.

*   Create and Start <Batching>
      `_createAndStartBatching()`: The internal `_startWorkflow` is a stub and does not actually start the workflow (e.g., via `this.workflowExec.startWorkflow` or triggering a Lambda).

*   Create and Start <Moving>
      `_createAndStartMoving()`: The internal `_startWorkflow` is a stub and does not actually start the workflow. Marked as `// **remaining startMoveEmailsWorkflow`.
      further explanation

*   User-Action mark-task mutations
      `_stub()`: Stub explanation
      further explanation

*   Re-Sync
      `_initialize()`: Needs review regarding re-syncing after tackling a new task. Marked as `// **warning **do-not-ship`.
      figure out resyncing, will need to look at 'Open' and 'Ready' tasks.

*   Tasks
      for tasks, we need to update everything related to tasks as we now have parentid and also new knowledge.

*   On Complete
      Email user status.
      finish handleCompletion function with callback for next steps.

*   Testing
      - Make sure to go through each and every file, and total project, asking all LLMs for any obvious bugs.
      - Obviously line by line manual testing
      ** later automated tests

Up Next:


Post-Launch / Low Priority:
*   WorkflowExecutor.deleteWorkflow(): Recursive deletion and event deletion might take a long time if there are many events. Marked as `// **todo **can-ship **dangeous potentially`.
*   ResourceManager (Global): Resource gain and loss should be put in a reversible Transaction. Marked as `// *warning todo_post_launch`.
*   EmailCleaningAgent.ts: `batchEvents` and `moveEvents` in `CleaningAgentState` are commented out/placeholder.
*   EmailCleaningAgent.ts: `CleaningAgentState` type definition needs to be moved to `types/`. Marked as `// todo do-not-merge`.
*   endWorkflow: email user once a workflow is done.
*   move all dynamo actions to their own files (taskActions, workflowActions). never make dynamo queries in services.
**   general -> look through whole codebase, make sure any dynamo actions are in the actions folder.

Implemented / Status Check:
*   `instantiate()`: Implemented.
*   `create()`: Implemented.
*   `restart()`: Implemented. Now correctly stops ongoing Move workflows when Batch is completed.
*   `getState()`: Implemented.
*   `_sync()`: Implemented (with resource acquisition warning).
*   `_createAndStartCleaner()`: Implemented.
*   `_createAndStartBatching()`: Implemented (creation logic), but start logic is missing.
*   `_createAndStartMoving()`: Implemented (creation logic), but start logic is missing.
*   `_fetchLatestEmailCleaningWorkflow()`: Implemented.
*   `_getOpenUserTasks()`: Implemented.
*   `WorkflowExecutor` methods (`getStatus`, `stopWorkflow`, `startWorkflow`, `queryLatestChildWorkflowBy`, `deleteWorkflow`): Implemented. `deleteWorkflow` now uses `TASKS_GSI_CREATED_BY_NAME` for efficient task deletion.
*   `ResourceManager` methods (`acquireResources`, `relinquishResources`): Implemented.
