Answer in one sentence. i need to talk through something. I've got this concept of a Workflow. 
Each instantiation of a Workflow is kept in the user-workflows table. 
Now a Workflow can have a child workflow, or many of them. 
So instead of forcing a schema with Children workflows, 
we simply have sub-types that inherit all properties of the main Workflow, 
but have information such as the follow up workflows. 
Now the issue is that the base workflow CAN encounter an Error. 
And in that scenario we need to restart it. 
The issue here is when we want to start the child workflow, we need to ask it specifically if it can start. 
It can start if it has the resources it needs, 
AND the root workflow is finished processing. 
OR the root workflow needs to be restarted. 
This is very complex you see. 
Now if the root workflow IS Complete, without error, 
AND we have the Resources, we should start the Mover Workflow. 
Now the problem becomes if for some reason it is already started, 
or ongoing and expired, or error, then we need to restart, 
and update the root workflow to reference this new workflow. 
Holy shit right? Answer in one sentence.
