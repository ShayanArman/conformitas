1. Make the Email Cleaner show Email Viewer

2. Payments make better.

3. Google Outlook Workflow Manager 
The issue is that the Cleaner and Sync both rely on Google.
We have to have a way to 'get' an Object that can interact with Google
if no current workflows are running.

4. SideBar to include Sync, Workflows, Contacts? (P2) can ship without this.



// ========================================================
marketing. marketing. marketing.


I'm thinking make the entire application except a few Free. (Emailer/Sales + Transactions/Accounting)
So add a Free tier.
Then when they log in, auto look for all running workflows. 
Run the Email Cleaner workflow.
Ping the backend for the top 100 workflows.
If there are NONE running, then run the Email Cleaner.
Show the currently running workflow in cards.
