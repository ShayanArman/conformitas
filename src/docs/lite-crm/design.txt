// Its mainly about finding the intersection of all these contacts first. THEN running a filter on them.
/* 
** ----- Overview -----
** Upload all contact file types, we "Sync" them into a "Pool"
** Other Org users can then "Upload" their own Contacts into the DB, in their own "Pool",
** these Pool views are necessary, because it can get crazy if you have 3/4 Users Uploading "Pools",
** Also a potential source of extra contacts: "Hey Shayan, can I have your Pool?"
** ------ AI etc.  -----
** AI: is mainly used here in the `Filters` where we create Filters around the Contacts
** Depending on the tier of the Org, we will have different numbers of filters. Since we need to effectively keep track of all filters.
** ------ Steps    -----
** 1) ingest 
** 2) sync / enrich (find common contacts from icloud and gmail and indtgram etc) 
** 3) filter (make sure we only show the user the ones that fit their criteria)

**  /lite-network
**  /pools   -> { 
      functions: [],

    }
** we see each *Pool by /pool/?pool-name=<pool-unique-name>&filter=<filter-name>
** we see all-org contacts by /pool/?pool-name=<org-name>&filter=<filter-name>
** this is because a Pool can have multiple "filters" on it that have ran before
**  /uploads -> { 
      functions: [], 
      workflows: [ (upload file), (sync contacts / find intersections) ]
    }
**  /filters -> { 
      functions: [ (createFilter), (getFilters) ], 
      workflows: [ ( run filter on all contacts in org ) ]
