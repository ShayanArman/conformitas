Exa Compliance
Shayan Arman


The Construction industry, for its apparent lack of technology, already has a ripe Software backing. Reason being that large projects, and corporations in the industry, have a lot of moving parts. A single project, say building a hospital in a not so remote location, requires heavy coordination. Imagine just the materials needed to bring such a building to fruition.

This need for coordination of assets, labour, finances and timelines, has spawned a great many software startups (Procore, Briq) and giants (Autodesk Construction Cloud) to enter the space. 

Exa, being a highly tuned modern search engine, can provide great value in this space. One of the problems that every project faces is regulatory compliance. The difficulty in search, managing exact requirements, is apparent in the construction industry. Using Exa’s search api, I believe we can provide a quick solution to companies facing these problems of regulatory approvals.

Why Internet Search APIs?
Given the diversity of projects, we cannot possibly foresee every single project that could be made. 
Regulations are constantly changing across jurisdictions. Meaning keeping a `Constant` source of truth is impossible.
Multiple jurisdictions across the planet all have their own regulations. From building in the Middle East (Dubai) with its own local laws, to rural British Columbia Canada.

Managing all this as a standalone startup providing regulatory information to construction companies would be a heavy task. Using Exa’s search API capability, we can quickly provide value on top of the work Exa has already done (indexing and organizing the Internet’s information, with an AI layer for complex querying).

Given the size of the construction industry, and the recurring creation of new projects, plus the ever-changing regulatory landscape, we recommend Exa providing AI enhanced Compliance Search capabilities for the Construction Industry.
